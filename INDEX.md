# Index of foreign prompts

Every prompt in this repo, every published version, and the digest of each one's bytes.

**This index cannot give you a confirmation phrase, by design.** A phrase is a consent
sentence plus an id plus a digest. The digest is here — a document cannot contain its own
hash, so publishing it out of band is the intended route. The consent sentence is *not*:
it lives in each prompt's final `## Consent` section, which you reach by reading the
document. Index plus document gives you a phrase. Index alone does not.

Verify a digest against what you actually fetched:

```
curl -s <url> | shasum -a 256
```

If it disagrees with this table, you and this index are not looking at the same
document. Do not adopt it; open an issue.

Regenerate with `bin/fp-index`, which also writes `index.json` — the same data, machine-readable, and the thing a signature covers. `make test` fails if either drifts from the prompts.
